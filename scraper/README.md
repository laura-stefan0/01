## Usage

### Enhanced Scraper (Recommended)

Run the enhanced scraper with all new features:

```bash
cd scraper
node enhanced-italian-scraper.js
```

### Test Functionality

Test the enhanced features:

```bash
cd scraper
node test-enhanced-scraper.js
```

### Original Basic Scraper

Run the basic scraper:

```bash
cd scraper
node italian-protest-scraper.js
```

### As a Module

You can also import and use the scraper in other Node.js applications:

```javascript
import { runScraper } from './italian-protest-scraper.js';

// Run the scraper
await runScraper();
```

## Configuration

### Supabase Connection

The scraper is pre-configured with Supabase credentials. If you need to change them, update these variables in the script:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'your-supabase-url';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-supabase-anon-key';
```

### Keywords

The scraper uses two sets of Italian keywords:

**Protest Keywords** (events MUST contain at least one):
- manifestazione, protesta, sciopero, presidio, corteo, occupazione
- sit-in, mobilitazione, marcia, picchetto, concentramento
- assemblea pubblica, iniziativa politica, blocco stradale, pride

**Exclude Keywords** (events containing these are filtered out):
- concerto, spettacolo, festival, mostra, fiera, mercatino
- messa, celebrazione, evento gastronomico, laboratorio
- evento sportivo, corsa, maratona, dj set, sagra, reading
- workshop, meditazione, presentazione

### Adding New Sources

To add new websites to scrape, add them to the `SCRAPE_SOURCES` array:

```javascript
const SCRAPE_SOURCES = [
  // existing sources...
  { url: 'https://newsite.com', name: 'newsite.com' }
];
```

## How It Works

1. **Website Scraping**: The scraper visits each configured website and extracts content using CSS selectors
2. **Content Filtering**: Text is analyzed for protest-related keywords while excluding non-protest events
3. **Data Extraction**: For each valid event, the scraper extracts:
   - Title and description
   - Date and time (converted to YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Address and city
   - Event images
4. **Duplicate Detection**: Before saving, the scraper checks for existing events with the same title, date, and city
5. **Geocoding**: Addresses are converted to coordinates using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim service
6. **Category Assignment**: Events are automatically categorized based on content analysis
7. **Database Storage**: Valid, non-duplicate events are saved to the Supabase database

## Output

The scraper provides detailed console output including:

- Number of events found per source
- Duplicate detection notifications
- Successful saves to database
- Final statistics and category breakdown

## Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: The scraper includes 1-second delays between operations to be respectful to external services
- **Website Changes**: If target websites change their HTML structure, the scraper may need updates
- **Geocoding**: Uses free OpenStreetMap service which has rate limits
- **Static Content Only**: Cannot scrape JavaScript-rendered content (would need Playwright/Puppeteer for that)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Network Timeouts**: Some websites may be slow or unavailable. The scraper will continue with other sources.

2. **Geocoding Failures**: If geocoding fails, events default to Milan coordinates (45.4642, 9.1900).

3. **No Events Found**: Check if the target websites have changed their HTML structure.

### Debugging

Enable verbose logging by adding console.log statements or modify the timeout values if websites are consistently timing out.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the scraper:

- **Social Media Integration**: Add Facebook and X/Twitter scraping using Playwright
- **Advanced Content Extraction**: Use AI/NLP for better event detail extraction
- **Image Processing**: Download and host images locally instead of hotlinking
- **Scheduling**: Add cron job support for automated daily scraping
- **Webhook Integration**: Send notifications when new events are found
